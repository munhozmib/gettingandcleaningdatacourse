# gettingandcleaningdatacourse
This repo was created to share the project developed in week 4 of the course Getting and Cleaning Data, offered by Coursera and John Hopkins University.

There is a script called run_analysis.R .

The script assumes you have already downloaded the .zip file requested by the project. If you haven't, the link is https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The first part of the script is completely commented, and should only be used if you want the script to read the files in two different data sets: training set and testing set. 

From there, each "exercise" (from 1 to 5) has its title commented and the code on how to perform it.
You might want to run each exercise at a time, by selecting it on RStudio and clicking on "run".
