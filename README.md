# gettingandcleaningdatacourse

Welcome to munhozmib's solution!

This repo was created to share the project developed in week 4 of the course Getting and Cleaning Data, offered by Coursera and John Hopkins University.

There is a script called run_analysis.R .

The script assumes you have already downloaded the .zip file requested by the project. If you haven't, the link is https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The first part of the script, until line 35, is completely commented, and should only be used if you want the script to read the files in two different data sets: training set and testing set. 

From there, each "exercise" (from 1 to 5) has its title commented and the code on how to perform it.
You might want to run each exercise at a time, by selecting it on RStudio and clicking on "run".

At the end of each exercise, you can type View("dataframe") to see the results. 

There is a file called data_set_3.txt in this repo, which is the data resultant from the tidying work. 

There is also a code book, descibring each variable in the data set.
